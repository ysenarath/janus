# Documentation Consistency Verification

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### 1. Interface Consistency
✓ Document interface matches across all files
✓ Error codes consistently defined
✓ Event names follow same pattern
✓ Type definitions are uniform

### 2. Architectural Alignment
✓ Component structure matches API design
✓ Worker implementation aligns with technical considerations
✓ Storage strategy consistent with performance requirements
✓ Error handling approach uniform across layers

### 3. Implementation Feasibility
✓ Memory limits realistic for browser environment
✓ Storage quotas align with IndexedDB limitations
✓ Worker operations respect browser constraints
✓ Performance targets achievable

### 4. Security Coverage
✓ Content validation comprehensive
✓ Storage encryption considered
✓ Input sanitization thorough
✓ Rate limiting properly scoped

## Identified Gaps

### 1. Offline Support
- Need to specify sync strategy when connection restored
- Cache invalidation policy needed
- Conflict resolution approach required

### 2. Browser Limitations
- Need to specify minimum browser versions
- WebAssembly fallback strategy required
- SharedArrayBuffer availability handling needed

### 3. Performance Edge Cases
- Large document chunking strategy needed
- Search timeout handling required
- Memory pressure handling in workers needed

## Recommendations

### 1. Additional Documentation Needed
- Offline mode technical specification
- Browser compatibility matrix
- Performance optimization guide
- Security best practices guide

### 2. Implementation Considerations
- Add progressive enhancement strategy
- Include accessibility requirements
- Define telemetry requirements
- Specify monitoring approach

### 3. Testing Requirements
- Add performance benchmark suite
- Include security audit checklist
- Add accessibility testing plan
- Include browser compatibility test suite
